# Advent of Code - 2023

If you have no idea what this is: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for various skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023.\
So spoilers ahead! (duh)

# Disclaimer
- The Solutions are not optimized for speed or memory usage. They are just a quick and dirty solution to get the right answer.
- But the solutions are as far as AOC goes, correct
- I use no generative AI or the Internet to solve the puzzles. I'm doing them by hand. So all I have is my knowledge.
The only exception is the input. I need external input for some languages to know how to read a file. 
In theory, I could put the input in the code, but that is unreadable. So I put the input in a file and read it from there.
